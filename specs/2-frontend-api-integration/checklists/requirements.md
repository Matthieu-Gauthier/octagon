- [x] Edge cases are identified (implied in requirements FR-003, FR-006, FR-007)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (Backend API availability)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
