# Specification Quality Checklist: Fetch UFC Event

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../../specs/5-fetch-ufc-event/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Checked all items; the specification avoids implementation specifics (aside from mentioning 'API or scraping' as paths but defining the outcome), features measurable outcomes (time metrics and percentage of data points), and defines clear domain boundaries.
